Final


1.) I got phase one to work and a little bit of phase tow. The tables that I made are not functioning. 
2.) I never really got too deep into the third phase, I am knew to Howard so i never found a partner because i did not know anyone and everyone paired up.
3.) I learned to spend more time on the plan phase and actually making a strategy towards a project. Most of my time spent on my project was fixing silly errors. Also to ask more questions to make sure I understand the subject matter better
4.) A lot of the problems I had I inquired other classmates about them, but most of them I used online resources. Like the means of stackoverflow, that website really helped me
5.) I had no team members
6.) I actually do look to try to finish this because I learned so much. I also want to work on similar projects like this. I really learned a lot. Even though i experienced problems like my laptop dying. So I really do want to do this from the beginning.
